### To build the case you need:
|Count|Part|
|-|-|
|1|[Top plate](layer-top.dxf)|
|2|[Top frame](layer-frame-top.dxf)|
|1|[Switchplate](layer-plate.dxf)|
|2|[Bottom frame with USB cutout](layer-frame-bottom-usb.dxf)|
|2|[Bottom frame without USB cutout](layer-frame-bottom.dxf)|
|1|[Bottom plate](layer-bottom.dxf)|
|3|[Big feet plate](layer-feet-big.dxf)|
|2|[Small feet plate](layer-feet-small.dxf)|
|1|[Bottom feet plate](layer-feet-bottom.dxf)|

The case is designed to be built out of 2mm acrylic sheets with the switchplate in 1.5mm.  
For screwing everything together m2 standoffs and screws are used.

The case angle can be adjusted by the number of feet plates you attach to it.<br>
With six plates you will get roughly six degrees of typing angle.

Note: This has not been tested so far and is purely a concept.<br>
If you want to make this case the risk is entirely up to you. I do not guarantee that it works or fits.
